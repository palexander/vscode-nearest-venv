All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.3] - 2025-10-02
- Remember the workspace roots we set in `analysis.include`, removing the previous entry before adding the current one to avoid stacking Cursor Pyright includes.
- Keep `analysis.extraPaths` in sync with the active venv plus any open editorsâ€™ environments while pruning only the entries we manage.
- Add logging around include/extraPaths updates to make troubleshooting easier.

## [1.0.2] - 2025-09-29
- Improve Pyright virtual workspace setup by using the project root, wiring in the active venv's `site-packages`, and pruning managed `analysis.extraPaths` entries as interpreters change.
- Keep type checking focused by excluding hidden directories from analysis by default.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-09-26
- Update extension metadata for the Visual Studio Marketplace under the `thespacebar` publisher and correct the repository link.
- Bundle the MIT license with published packages.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-22
- First public release of Nearest Venv Interpreter.
- Automatically select the closest virtual environment when working in Python files.
- Optional Pyright virtual workspace configuration for VS Code and Cursor.
- Output channel logging and manual refresh command.
